Many students got placed in the government sectors like the Ministry of Health, etc. Few students also got a chance to visit countries like UK.\nPlacements: Placement cell was mostly run by students on their own responsibility. The involvement of teachers was less. Many students got placed in this course. Top recruiting companies were KPMG, Deloitte, Edgewise Tokyo, Nelson Private Ltd, PWC, etc. Many students got a chance in government sectors.\nPlacements: In mathematics, there is no direct placement but this year few foundations came and provided jobs to a few candidates in mathematics as an associate. Also, some of them get job as teachers in their effort and this is more beneficial for further research work.\nPlacements: B.Tech in Central University is very new, so there are not yet 100% placements, but as of now, 1 batch has been passed out, and they had 8 students in it; 3 got campus placements with an average of INR 11 LPA. But what we know till now is that in 2026 we will be sitting in campus placement at LMNIT Jaipur as Central University has some kind of tie-up with them. Other than placements, the teachers are good, and some of them are very good. They will encourage you to study and develop extra skills;...\nPlacements: Placements are not so good. B.Tech is established only in the year of 2019. So, we are getting small companies for the placements.\nPlacements: Around 40% of students got placed in companies. Training courses are also provided by this university. The minimum salary package offered was 4 LPA. The top roles offered are HR, sales, marketing, accountant, and financial roles.\nPlacements: Fewer students get placed in our college. The highest salary package offered is 12 LPA and the lowest salary package is 4 LPA. Our college provides good opportunities in the research sector. There are no recruiting companies for our course.\nPlacements: The maximum package was around 35000 \/month in aeronautics or as assistance scientists. Almost 50-60 of students gets various internships. What amount of package you get completely depends on your own abilities. University play a minor role in it so thats it.\nPlacements: Many apply for further studies. Some prepare for competitive exams. There is very little chance of placement in this university with Physics course. Some alumni are employed in education sector now. If you are looking for placement then don't come here as there is no placement offered by this university.",

        "Placements": "Placements: I am from 2022 batch and my branch here is information technology. The percentage of students who got placed are 90 percent.

The college has only 2 branches i.e., CSE and ECE which makes it less crowded and helps freshers to reach the seniors and faculty members with ease and flexibility. The faculty members have a great knowledge in their respective fields.\nPlacements: We can't predict the average or the highest package of electronics and communication department because the first batch of this department hasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t graduated yet. The first batch will pass out in 2025. The percentage of students getting internships in ECE department not predictable either.\nPlacements: Placements are good at our college.

        "Review": "Placement is good, and the college is decent. IIIT Pune can give you high-package jobs. The college is going to shift to the main campus mostly by the end of 2024 or at the start of 2025. The really good infrastructure and placements were the best at this college. Difficulties due to the temporary campus. Best college in Pune, worth it. I am not satisfied with this college because I love to play games. Despite the absence of a physical campus, the coding culture and job placements are exceptional. The coding culture and placements are excellent, but the campus fails to meet expectations. Come only for placements, not for college life. Good placements but the infrastructure is below par levels as for now. Overall college is good and infrastructure is also decent. Competition is good, coding culture is good. Facilities provided by college are nothing. Satisfaction hits instantly when you arrive here. Honest Review of IIIT Pune. Good for placement and average campus life. I am satisfied with our college because of its faculty members. Indian Institute of Information technology, Pune is really great. Our institute provides very good placements but average campus life. IIIT, an institute of national importance is located in Pune, an IT hub with challenging cutoffs.",

Consequently, it becomes challenging to maintain an average package exceeding 12 LPA. Currently, our average package stands at 10 LPA, with the highest package being 34 LPA.\nPlacements: The overall effect on campus placements of the recession can be seen. The campus lacks infrastructure, which is a main reason that big companies are not coming to provide on-campus placements.

But, the students here are talented and hopeful for their placements. It is therefore probable that an average package of Rs. 5 lacs will be given, with the highest package offered to be Rs. 9 lacs at our college.",

NIT GOA has more than 90% placement because it is Goa, companies come here.\nPlacements: The placement percentage of Computer Science engineering is 100% whereas the placement of electrical and electronics engineering is roughly around 85%.

Top roles offered are that of Design Trainee, Graduate Engineer Trainee, Cell and battery innovation center (R&D), Management Trainee etc.\nPlacements: The placement being provided by the online degree team is not what you will expect from IIT madras. The placement are equivalent to any tier 3 engineering college. The placements clearly define that the companies do not treat the online degree as usual IIT Madras degree.\nPlacements: Approximately 90% of students get placed, but most of the students go for higher studies like M.Tech. and MS. There are also many on-campus internships available, and the number of students who got internships is not more, but yes, 50% of the students get placed as per the previous record.\nPlacements: More than 90 percent of students are placed on campus. The package is also high. It also provides internship programs and industrial projects to the students in the college.

The main companies in which internships are offered are Mahindr...\nPlacements: Placement rates are typically high; most of the students got placements The highest package is around 15-20 LPA, and the lowest is 5-7 LPA. The average package is 8\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015310 LPA. The top recruiters are from ISRO, DRDO, and BARC. The most secure internships are at research institutions. The top roles are research scientist and data analyst.\nPlacements: The placement in M.Sc. Maths isn't very high. The course curriculum is focused on pure Maths. M.Sc. students are in high demand by coaching institutes for IIT JEE. All students who applied for placements are placed in coaching institutes, with the highest package being 12 Lacs per annum.\nPlacements: The students of Maths department are more inclined towards higher studies. So a less number of students participated in placement drive. Though a less number of students applied for job. Most of them are placed in edtech companies.

But some sources say that students get internships at big companies and also get a handsome package. Some of the top roles that one can get from a BS in Data Science and Application are data scientist, data analyst, and many more.\nPlacements: Placements official data from the college is pending. However, it's anticipated that companies will visit the campus between May and June 2024, making the first placements of students. On average, salaries are expected to range around 3 LPA, with the possibility of some students securing packages as high as 6 to 7 LPA.\nPlacements: Placement data is not yet released by the college official. Also, in this year, May and June, most of the companies will visit campus, and this year 2024 will be the first time when students are getting placed. We can assume an average of 3 LPA and a maximum package can be of 6-7 LPA.\nPlacements: Placements are very well as I have heard from seniors, also the support of placement cell is very good. The top recruiting companies are L&T, Amazon etc., most of the jobs are in data Science field, mostly data Science or data analyst intern in the companies.\nPlacements: The course is very good and easy to use and the placement rates are excellent so many students get placed in by completing this course. It's also an opportunity to pursue another course side by side so we get double placement. They also provide internships for students.\nPlacements: They do have an industry interaction cell (IIC), which connects you to the company. The course is good and gives you enough knowledge to be a data scientist. Don't expect too much from packages for B.Tech. students. I will definitely say that the internship opportunities are great.\nPlacements: Placement is available but you have to be skilled for that. This is a little tough. Generally, placements are available only after your diploma in programming and your diploma in data science are done. So be prepared for that in the best manner that you can .\nPlacements: Really satisfied with the placement programme. Many companies do visits our college like google, facebook, amazon, etc. Every year about 95% of students grab the highest packages from the companies.

IIT palakkad : nurturing minds for the better world. Really good infrastructure and facilities. Not worthy of the IIT tag. I am satisfied with this college, but not with the food. IIT Pallakkad is an excellent college. I am very satisfied with this college and I urge everyone to try for IITs. Our college provides average faculty members but very good academic facilities.

        "Review": "Review of Institute of Infrastructure Technology Research and Management. It is a good college for core branch students. In this college, infrastructure and placements are not good. I recommend that this college is very good for study and not for other things. The infrastructure is great but could gave been good if campus life and fests are improved. Industrial education, high college fees. It has good infrastructure and that attracted me, and the academics are great here. If you want to learn skills which MNCs want from you, then take admission here. It is a nice college, and it has a really amazing infrastructure. You should definitely take admission in IITRAM, and you won't regret it. Review of IITRAM - Institute of Infrastructure Technology Research and Management. Good for improving your engineering skills but extra curricular activities will not improve. I am satisfied with the education provided by the college. Absolutely satisfied by the faculty, college office department, canteen etc. Great value for money and good faculty. Our college is better than the other government colleges, but it is not as good as IITs or NITs. A respectable college and good placements, but dissatisfied with the faculty. My college is good as per my JEE Mains rank. IITRAM: Estd by government of Gujarat. Excellent institute with state of the art Siemen's center of excellence.",

Top companies also take students for opportunities starting from 5 th semester. The average stipend is around 40000 per month and the highest stipend goes over 1 Lacs.\nPlacements: Placements in MANIT Bhopal are quite good, but this year, due to the recession season, we also face the same shortage of companies visiting this year. But apart from IT companies, the placement record for core companies was quite good. The average package for the mechanical branch this year was 10 lacs. And more than 75% of students get placed.\nPlacements: From a placement point of view, MANIT provides very good placement. Last year, almost 85% of students were placed on campus. The highest package, according to last year in my department, was offered for about 45 lacs, the average was 15 lacs, and the lowest was 7 lacs. Many famous companies offer placement to MANIT students, like Amazon and Google.\nPlacements: MANIT's placement percentage is amazing; it is about 85% of students who are placed. The highest package offered at MANIT is by Atlassian, which is 85 Lacs, while the average package is 26 Lacs, and the lowest package is 8 Lacs from Computer Science. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Atlassian come to MANIT. In the final year, MANIT also provides internships to students.\nPlacements: Almost 80% of students got placed in mechanical engineering. The highest package offered is 19 LPA. And the average package was 9 LPA. The major companies visiting in this field are Tata, Maruti, Kia, and other giant manufacturing companies. In the third year, approximately 10-15 students were assigned to internships.\nPlacements: MANIT is very concerned about placement. We can see this by the fact that last year, about 86% of students were placed in computer science, and 8 of them got the highest package of 85 lacs and some got 51 lacs, or the average package of MNAIT is 26 lacs, and the lowest package is 8 lacs. Students are placed in very good positions at famous companies like Amazon, Atlassian, Google and many more. Almost 90% of students get internships from colleges, and some get off-campus internships.\nPlacements: About 90% of students got placed in my college and the highest package offered was 82 lacs per annum for the company Atlassian. The lowest package offered is 6 lacs per annum. Top recruiting companies include Infosys, Wipro, Google, Microsoft, Bajaj, Bosch, and MSCI. The top roles offered are software development engineer and business analyst.\nPlacements: Placements are still ongoing on the campus, the highest package is 19 LPA and the average package is 9.5 LPA.

The roles offered include GET role, Software Developer, and Management role.\nPlacements: Nearly 80 to 90% of students have been placed. The highest package was 20 LPA, and the average was 13 LPA. BPCL and Western Digital are top offering companies. Nearly 70% of students got internship offers. Maximum offers were for graduation engineer and trainee technical officer.\nPlacements: If you are into placements, then please don't choose architecture. Placements are average here; you can expect 4 to 5 LPA. But after a few years of experience, you can be at 10 to 12 LPA. We do have a placement cell but that is not that active at bringing high-paying companies up to this point in time.\nPlacements: If you believe that you will secure a job placement after obtaining a B.Plan degree, let me dispel that notion. Not only in SPA but in all colleges offering this degree, there are no placements at all. You will have to search for a job on your own. Opting for higher studies in any IIT or a similar institution is always a better option.\nPlacements: Only a few students get placed every year as there are very few jobs in architecture, the recruiting companies pay very little, the working hours are very high, and there is no work-life balance. The only way out is to start your own firm. Most students pursue Masters either in planning or go abroad rather than getting placed.\nPlacements: The percentage of students placed in our college is extremely low, as this course is not much in demand and therefore most of the students are willing to open their venture, which makes the placement percentage in our college low, i.e., 82%, according to data for our year.\nPlacements: There are no placements in this course. But studying here will help you produce a good portfolio for recruitment. A good portfolio is a result of personal efforts and development.\nPlacements: The application process for jobs has to be carried out by the students alone. The training and placement cell is not that great with finding good job opportunities for the students. The graduates are hired as fresher architects. But I would say the SPA tag adds to having you stand out in the market.\nPlacements: This particular course did not have any placements, but it provides students with options for self-growth. But students can see themselves if they are fortunate enough to crack our respective states' assistant town planner jobs. Students can even apply for any real estate company for a consultant or surveyor.\nPlacements: Only 25 percent of the students got placed from our batch. Annual gross salary offered were in the range of around 5 Lacs to 6 Lacs. Recruiters approached were mainly privately owned educational Institutions and universities. Internship was compulsory for all for M Arch Conservation in SPA Bhopal. Practicing on site conservation procedures or performing research under a Senior Professional expert, working in an NGO or any other organisation which undertakes Conservation and restoration projects ...\nPlacements: The placements in SPA, Bhopal have started this year, after a lot of struggle dealt by authority of institute. The placements for Masters are okay for now, it is increasing, and there is hope for Bachelors. But as observed from previous records, it is better than other institutes.\nPlacements: The college has a placement cell, but there are no college placements. The student has to get a job in a company for our own. It depends on your work and skill, and the remaining doesn't matter. Most of the companies visit the college and hire for internships.\nPlacements: No placements, 100% internships -internship is mandatory for 6months present scenario for 2015-20 batch, for later on batches 1 year is compulsory. Internships are done in both national and international during internships 70000inr (max in foreign in 2018)-for free also min there is placement cell, useful in providing firms information useful during internship time.\nPlacements: Much cannot be said about the placements as the architecture graduates do not prefer the in-campus placements. Also, the average salary offered after graduating from Bachelors of Architecture is nearly Rs. 20,000 per month. The minimum is somewhere near to Rs. 15,000 per month and you can expect up to Rs. 30,000. For the internships, students are easily placed and can expect stipends starting from Rs. 5,000 per month to even Rs. 50,000 at times. Also, 10 to 15 students intern overseas here.\nPlacements: Basically, there are no campus placements done in the field of planning and architecture, but internships are there in the college. We need to have a good experience in order to get a good job. But who knows what may happen, maybe the architecture companies will also do campus placements in the coming years. But if they do so, SPA-Bhopal will be on the top of their priorities as our college has had produced so many great architects.\nPlacements: Our college has a training and placement cell, though right now, it only provides recommendations. Most of our seniors are placed at good firms either through recommendations or the connections we develop throughout our academic period. The minimum salary offered was around Rs 30,000 in the beginning and the maximum is around Rs 50000 (again starting).\nPlacements: The highest package offered by the companies is around Rs 7,00,000 per annum for this course. The average package offered by the companies is around Rs 5,50,000 per annum for this course. The college also provides internships to the students with a fixed stipend.\nPlacements: More than 70 students were placed in B.Arch. The faculty members here are the best. Students always about the study friendly atmosphere they provide here. Students from here have been placed in many government companies.70% got internship. All seniors told us that no one will be left out during internship. Worth coming here .\nPlacements: The placement in our college is not that great when it comes to our department or course MEM. The percentage of students that get placed in our department stands at 80%, and the highest and lowest packages are not known to us because the university is reluctant to disclose them to us, and the students also have to apply for internships themselves.\nPlacements: The highest package in my college is about INR 78 lacs, the lowest package in my college is about INR 6 lacs, and the average package in my college is about INR 3 lacs. Top recruiting companies come to my college and give us placements.\nPlacements: Placements are not good in our course. You can get a decent job after completing the course.\nPlacements: Placements are not provided by the college, and students need to search for a job on their own. Even in off-campus placements, we get low salary packages. Planning is a vast scale job, so earning for the city development is a bit hard and requires a lot of hard work.\nPlacements: People mostly prefer to study masters after their Bachelor Degree. 30% of students prefer taking up Masters, and 50% start taking up professional practice on their own, and a few prefer joining in the top firms. Some students are offered 30,000 per month, and some get 1 Lac per month. Some may even get more, but everything depends on the talent of the student. As it is architecture, you can't estimate the package as you can estimate for engineering students, but the highest package can be 30 LP...\nPlacements: Being the first batch of MBEM, the students of this batch is yet to go through the placement procedures. But the students of SPAV have been previously placed in some of the eminent design and planning firms. Many of them have been accepted to pursue their higher education in several national and internationally acclaimed research institutes.\nPlacements: I can proudly say that everyone in our batch have chosen various streams of work as per their own interest such as being academicians, researchers, sustainable building consultants, and many more important and responsible positions with state and central government departments and private agencies as well. This resulted in no need for placement drive for our batch.\nPlacements: Our course is introduced newly and first batch has to be passed out. Due to pandemic, situations didn't allow for internships otherwise students would have done internships. Top roles offered in the course are project manager or a construction manager.\nPlacements: Students who applied for jobs got them from our college. The salary package offered to students is course-based. Above-average salary packages will be offered for recently passed out architecture graduates in the country. Students are usually offered jobs of juniors architects. SPA has high respect in the job market.\nPlacements: Around 5% of the students got placed. A few students went to pursue Masters in good and recognised national and international universities. The average salary offered is Rs. 35,000 per month, in the on-campus placements. Top-recruiter of our college is GMR company. Most of the students got internships on their own. Some were assisted by the faculty members and the college department.\nPlacements: 70% of my batch mates are placed and the minimum package offered is 6 lacs per annum and the maximum is 12 lacs per annum. About 70 members are placed in 17 multi-national companies around the country. About 20 members are placed at the consultancy firms for the state and central governments.\nPlacements: From my experience, it's a diverse course where the students choose their career options like opting for higher education (PG or PhD), entrepreneurship or working in MNCs, offices, firms and also prepare for government jobs. Some of the students choose to work in the movie field as set-designers and assistant directors etc. The training and placement cell of the institute also supports the students by showing different job opportunities, especially in MNCs or in the government sector. Private fi...\nPlacements: Placements in a college of architecture and planning are not required. The students here are well-equipped with the necessary means to get a job on their own means and of their own choice. From my experience, even if placements are offered, the students who get selected do not take up the offer and those who do, do not last long in the same place, mainly because of the nature of the job we do. Other than for this, the faculty do their best to help the students in all ways possible, such as getti...\nPlacements: Students from SPA Vijayawada got placed very well in top design, architecture and planning firms and companies, research institutes and generally opt for their professional life. As our university focuses on providing practical and research-oriented education, students are very well-equipped with the knowledge which is desired in the field. There is an active placement cell in our institute, which strived to provide great placement offers to students from the year 2018. The placement cell provid...\nPlacements: Since it is architecture and planning college, placements are not very popular. Most of the graduating students look for firms matching their interest and in favorable locations and apply. However, from the college end, they prepare a placement brochure which is a consolidated document containing information about students of the graduating batch. This brochure is then mailed to various firms across India to aid in placements.\nPlacements: Until the batch which graduated last year, there was no placement cell in college. All the students who got placed in the firms had to make their arrangements and efforts but as of now, the effort has been made by the college, and a placement cell has been formed. Talking about the percentage of students who got placed, it was such that all of them who had interest in respective fields got placed, maybe not with good pay but they were placed, while the rest are pursuing further studies. When it ...\nPlacements: For my batch, none of the placements was provided by the college so far after taking our resumes and other details many a time. Only six out of the 30 students were placed from my senior's batch. Andhra Pradesh government has approached this college for certain projects, but none of them progressed to the placement or the real projects. Only six of them were mentioned before giving the priority to Telugu speaking students despite a central government university, and here, students are coming fro...\nPlacements: Presently, there is no placement cell in the architecture department. The college is planning to start a cell this year. About the internship, students who are not able to search for an internship on their own are helped by the college to get a good internship. The stipend ranges from 2 thousand to 12 thousand. Students working in Delhi got the highest stipend.",

        "Placements": "Placements: This year 20 students have been placed till date with Avishek Gope (CSE) and Mukul Pathak (CE) being one the best among all. The top companies are L&T, Adobe, Ashok Leyland and others this time. Sanskar Sharma (ECE) also the best one. 35% of students placed right now. The roles offered are educator and software developed etc. The highest package as of now would be 20LPA.\nPlacements: Outstanding placements in recent times have been recorded, with a lot of internship opportunities present. We get to know about different internships on and off campus on several social media platforms from the college to improve our resume and gain more skills in order to make ourselves industry-ready. The top companies are L&T, Ashok Leyland, Microsoft, etc. And all of them are offering decent packages too.\nPlacements: Students are generally placed in the 6th, 7th, and 8th semesters. Our recent years have been very impressive and very boastful. NIT Mizoram has witnessed a good increase in placement packages and ratios overall. Earlier, it used to be a 6.8 LPA average but now it is a 10.5 LPA average. We expect it to go much beyond that. The highest package remains from CSE. Next would be ECE and EE. Internships are also good here.\nPlacements: The college has excellent placement opportunities, as top-notch companies like Google and Adobe hire students from here. Our record of good packages offered to students is also noteworthy. In comparison to other NITs in the North East region, our college has better placement opportunities than Nagaland and Manipur. The Training and Placement department is very supportive and helpful.\nPlacements: 5\/5 for placements, as one would not expect such good placements in reputed companies with good salaries in hand. Students are placed in Adobe, L&T, Ashok Leyland, Cognizant, Lumiq, and other big companies with decent packages. We are very proud to maintain a 70 percent placement ratio, even though not all students are eligible to sit for college placements.\nPlacements: The top placement was given to Sanskar Sharma ECE branch this year, placed in both L&T and Adobe. The internships are also going all too well. Companies like Cognizant, L&T, Ashok Leyland and others have approached us. A decent number of students get placed each year, despite slumps in the global market.\nPlacements: Above-average placements, I would say, make the T&P very worthy. The new head is Sukanta Roy, who is the mastermind. The highest package offered is 14.6 LPA this year from CSE Avishek Gope. Internship-wise, this college also has impressive states. The percentage of students placed is 65 percent.\nPlacements: The highest package as of last year was 29.6 LPA and the lowest was 4.5 LPA. The percentage of students placed would be roughly 6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015370 percent. I find that not that concerning. This year too, the placements are on a good track and we hope they will get better with time, as the last semester is still left with us. The top companies are Adobe, Microsoft, and Amazon.\nPlacements: Top companies like Adobe, L&T, Cognizant, Tech Mahindra, and Lumia approach our college. In recent years, there has been a good spike in average placements at this institute of national importance. The majority of packages available range between 10 and 15 LPA. Internships are compulsory at the end of the 6th semester. We witnessed a decent percentage of students placed this year.\nPlacements: I am very satisfied and happy with recent placements, including this year in Lumiq, Alstrom, Unacademy, Adobe, L&T, and Cognizant. Average has also been appreciable and trustworthy. The number of students placed this year would be 30 to date and more accounting. These include both software and technical jobs.\nPlacements: The college has had a good record of placements in recent years, so there is no need to worry about them. Although the numbers were not impressive earlier, the students and T&P cell have shown their vigour in the last few years and have given record placements, whether on or off-campus. The top recruiters include Cognizant, L&T, Deloitte, Adobe, Tata, and Teach Mahindra. Almost every student does an internship by the end of the 7th semester.\nPlacements: Based on my research, this college has a good placement ratio with internships offered by companies such as L&T. The percentage of students placed is 70%, which is a positive sign. In the last year, there was a significant increase in the placement average, which stood at 10.8 LPA. As expected, the highest package was offered to CSE students, followed by ECE and EEE. Unfortunately, there is not enough data available to evaluate the placement statistics of other branches.\nPlacements: Top companies are Adobe, TCL, HCL, Cognizant, and L&T. Recently, our senior was also placed in Unacademy for a core job. The packages are high enough. The students are very serious about placements and career opportunities. Seventy-five percent of students were placed as of last year.\nPlacements: Placements are above average here. Personally, I have seen my seniors graduate with flying colors. The packages are good, better than many North East NITs. The Training and Placement (T&P) cell is very active and reliable. The new head of Training and Placement is Dr. Sukanta Roy; he is very knowledgeable and understanding. His efforts have made this NIT grow in all fields. Top recruiting companies include L&T, Cognizant, Tata, etc.\nPlacements: Talking about placements. This topic has been a point of honor for us, as these few have made a huge difference in the average package and placement percentage of our college. The average remains above 10 LPA, whereas the percentage of people placed is 60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015370 percent. That is actually a good number, as this college is highly underestimated.\nPlacements: Placements are very good from this college. As of this year too my senior just got placed in Unacadem Nihal sir from EEE branch who is also the branch toppers. The highest package till date is 19lpa. Top recruiting companies have been LT, Samsung, Delloite etc. Till date 50percent students placed this year.\nPlacements: Last year, placements were good, with an average package of INR 11.5 lacs. The highest package was from the EEE department (INR 29 lacs outside campus). The placement and training are fine and quite appreciable. Along with the training and placement, the cell is supportive of us.\nPlacements: Placements are fine with this college and have been for a few years. Top IT and other companies approach us in large numbers and have been successful with us in history. We have a good record in numbers with the highest package of 19.6 LPA last year from CSE.\nPlacements: The placement has been wonderful as of last year. The average package is 11.5 lacs per annum. The CSE department remains dominant among other branches which bag the highest package. The other branches including EEE and ECE have moderate but concrete packages. The placement is good.\nPlacements: Placement is very good at our college. Around 90 percent of students got good salary packages. The average salary package is INR 7.5 lacs, and the maximum salary offered is INR 28 lacs for ECE and CSE students. Some of the students got their internships at various firms at the start of their third year, e.g., Adobe, Microsoft, etc. The top recruitment companies are Adobe, Deloitte, Teleperformance, Tata Power, and TCS.\nInfrastructure: The library is open from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Many books are available. The hostel is good. They select a hostel president who manages all the hostel things. The quality of the food in the canteen is delicious.\nPlacements: In our department, there are 31 students. Our college does not provide job opportunities. Students are aware of the future.\nPlacements: There were about 7 students in our batch in our department out of the 500 students in the entire department. There are neither recruiting companies nor any other recruitment in this college. Two students from our batch got the 5th and 7th positions in the final year.\nPlacements: Around 50% of seats are reserved for Mizo people and the other 50% for JEE students. I am not so sure about the companies recruiting students. Around 90% of students got internships in multiple companies and government. Our university is below average.\nPlacements: Top roles offered are psychiatrist, therapist, consultancy, etc.\nPlacements: Last year, Oil India limited came here for campus placement and few other local companies too. Frankly speaking, not many students get internship because it's not a medical or engineering college.\nPlacements: Around 85-88% were placed. The highest percentage of students placed is 90%, the lowest is 60%, and the average is 70%. Top recruiting companies are Tata and Emo Matrix. Around 97% of students got internships in Emo Matrix. The roles offered are clinical and counseling Psychology and other similar courses.\nPlacements: About 20% were placed in our course. There are no recruiting companies or internships. Our course is one of the hardest courses in the arts, except for science. Many students are scared to core it and choose an easier one, which is an advantage for students who core economics subjects.\nPlacements: The college does not offer any job placement, though you can look for jobs somewhere after graduation. Many students pursue their master's degree somewhere else since the college does not offer master's courses either. Some do get jobs at private institutions and firms after their graduation.\nPlacements: Students who score above 60% in class 12 are admitted to our college. In every department in our college, we used to have counseling classes for every detail of our learning problems.\nPlacements: Around 45% were placed. The highest was 25 thousand, the lowest was 12 thousand and the average was 18 thousand. Aristo pharmaceuticals, sun pharma, Cipla, visited for placements. Everyone after completion of their course is given 3 months of industrial training in Hyderabad or any other pharmaceuticals.\nPlacements: There are 32 total seats in each course. I don't think salary packages are offered. There are no recruiting companies as we have to work in hospitals. Almost all students got internships from this course in every hospital, but we are not sure as it is corona time.\nPlacements: There will be a total of 40 seats in the 3rd B.Sc. (MPC). No campus placements are offered in our course. But there are campus placements for computer science students. Companies like TCS offer campus placements for the students of computer science. No internships are provided in my course. The package offered for computer science students is around 3 Lacs per annum in the beginning.\nPlacements: Not more than 30% of the students of our batch got placed through college placements. Almost 50% of our seniors got placements. Companies like Wipro, Infosys, and Power Grid visited our college to hire students. The highest package offered was Rs. 40,000 per month and the lowest was Rs. 19,500 per month. There is a placement cell under Zo-Tech committee, but it is not useful. Information about placement offers or campusing by companies are given at the last moment, and only a few can attend the ...\nPlacements: Placement is not good. For many years we don't have VC. We have new VC in early 2018 and may be things would change. After having VC one company from Thailand came and search for workers. I hope the placement would become better than before. But now the placement is not good at all.\nPlacements: We are the first batch, so there are no placements yet on the campus for the students. We hope to be the first to get a job through this university for our department. Even among students, we will be appointing the placement in charge, where we can highlight ourselves to the world. We hope some good companies visit the campus for the future ahead.\nPlacements: In our department there were no placement as it is not a professional course. But our department used to organize National and International conferences, workshops, seminars, training related to our studies as well as research work which helps us in gaining more knowledge about our subject.\nPlacements: So far placement is not so good, only few got placed. Those who were placed start from the lowest salary at 3 Lacs to the highest salary at 10 Lacs per annum. No companies came to our institution, but some PSU's placement took place. Most of the students got internship programme which is termed as industrial training. As a scholarship we got? 24,000. There is a placement cell, however most students does't utilise it.\nPlacements: Most of the campus placements come only for b.tech students rather than M.Sc students. Maybe this campus is newly established in the year 2008, so might be M.Sc graduates are not able to get campus placements. I hope in future; industries come to this University and students may get the job directly after completion of M.Sc course.\nPlacements: We would coordinate with NIT Mizoram for the placement cell. Two students from my senior batch were placed at Wipro. From my batch one student was placed at Wipro for a package of 3.3 Lacs for the role of Software Developer. Apart from Wipro, no other MNCs has visited the place. Apart from MNCs, Indian Army and Indian Navy had shown up as well for the recruitment at our place. In Mizoram University, as the department was newly placed, not much regarding placement was to be seen. Regarding intern...",
        "Review": "Buildings are far off forcing us to walk alot. Not much co-curricular activity but overall nice experience. Placements are good, weather and nature are at its best. Faculty is supportive but infrastructure will disappoint. The weather and views are too good to be real. Placements and curriculum are too well. Lack of facilities are there in a major course. Connectivity is a big issue here. Value for money which is better than 3 tier colleges. No sports activity available but Education is good. Don't expect too much from campus life but the weather is always awesome. Poor campus life but trustworthy placements . I would recommend this college for good placements. Value for money, better than 3rd tier pvt college. If you want good placements, you must join. New challenge in life at a new place but lot to learn. The college lacks infrastructure, but placements and weather is good. Placements are good . Lacks a Campus, but yet better than 3rd-tier Pvt colleges. The college lacks Infrastructure, but it has good placements. Review of Pachhunga University College. Review of Government Hrangbana College. I can say that it is the best college in the state. I am very satisfied because of the connection between the students and the teachers. Our college has good infrastructure and facilities. Absolutely satisfied! Good infrastructure and good lecturers. I was satisfied with the college. It offers good education, good infrastructure, and facilities. It is the best college in Mizoram. I have an amazing experience here. Really satisfied, worth the money. The college environment is good, and the hostel cleanliness is very good. Absolutely satisfied with sports facilities. Overall, I'm satisfied with our college, and I would rate it 3.5 out of 5. It is one of the best university in the Northeast India. The college is good so far, and hope it will grow even more to reach the point of excellence. Satisfied with the present situation. It's quite good, but not at its best! I would like to give 4.5 star out of 5 as I feel that this university is very nice. Just satisfied but not up to the mark if you are seeking for a competitive world.",

Top recruiting companies in NIT Meghalaya are L and T construction, wipro, Infosys, IBM, Power Grid, Microsoft, Tata and Bosch. Top roles offered in NIT Meghalaya are software developer, software engineer, web developer. Etc. The highest salary for civil engine...\nPlacements: Placements were good. The top companies are TCS, Wipro, TCI, IBM, Jaro Education, BYJU'S and many more. The highest package offered was approximately around 10-14 Lacs. Top roles offered were- Software developer, software engineer, Web developer and many other.\nPlacements: There are 28 students in our batch, so the percentage of students got placed is high, i.e., about 80-90%. The highest salary package offered is around 11-12 LPA. The lowest salary package offered is 3-4 LPA. The average salary package offered is 6- 7 LPA. In our branch, i.e., ECE, most of the students are placed in IT companies with the post of a developer, tester, etc. Few are placed in the management company.\nPlacements: Almost 50% of the students got placement in our course from college. The salary offered is approximately Rs. 20,000 to 50,000 per month. ONGC is a very good company for our course. In our course, the highest salary offered is 1 lac per month and the lowest salary offered is Rs. 15,000 per month. Almost 50% of the students got an internship in companies like IISER Mohali, IISER Pune, IISC Kolkata and IISC Bangalore.\nPlacements: There are placement offers in our college and companies visit here regularly. But most of the students prefer higher education rather than a job, and they seldom accept the offers. The salary offered ranges from Rs. 20,000 per month. Chemical companies and coaching institutes are the mass recruiter of this college who offers a job. Many students got an internship in a different institute during their M.Sc.\nPlacements: I am in the second year, so I don't know in detail about placements. But I have seen the data on NIRF that is submitted by college to the MHRD. The average salary package offered in the year 2018 was 5.4 LPA, and the highest salary package offered was 17.2 LPA. So I can say that NITM is a good college if you are a hard worker. More than 90% of students got placed in the year 2018. In our college, there is a centre for career development.\nPlacements: There are no placements for M.Sc. in our college. Even if the placements are provided sometimes, it is very difficult to sit for the drive because we have to compete with B.Tech students. I heard that there are placements for B.Tech students, especially for the ones in ECE and CSE departments.\nPlacements: The median package offered is around 5.2 LPA, last year. As the college is located in the central north-eastern region of India, it makes an ideal destination for conducting pool placement drives in the north-eastern region of India. The highest package offered was 17.2 LPA.",
        "Review": "A good college environment. I would recommend students to join this college. Good college because of the study level. As compared to IIITs and GFTIs, this NIT is very good. Best of returns, good placement records, and a good coding environment. In our college, placements are very good but facilities are not up to the mark. The salary packages are great but facilities are not good. Good placement and a good institute that is ranked in top 60 without its permanent campus . Good academic performance, better placements, enjoy clubs and fests but on a small level. The college is good from all the angles. Absolutely qualified faculty members and good infrastructures . Absolute dissatisfaction due to infrastructure and many facilities. Absolutely satisfied for me. Dissatisfied with its temporary campus and infrastructure. Satisfied with overall teaching. The course curriculum is relevant and it makes students ready for the IT sector. Our college is good. You can take admission in it. Students in this college will gain knowledge. It is the best college to gain knowledge. It is an excellent college in terms of academics and placements. Satisfied with the administration and their attitude towards the safety and upliftment of students. A good place to gain technical knowledge.",

If you do not get other NITs for your rank then you can take admission to this college. Our college has the best teachers. This college is the best. Our college has good faculty members, cooperative batchmates, and a good environment. It is a very good college. Review of NIT Uttarakhand - National Institute of Technology. Our college provides good placements. Infrastructure which is improving these days so I can say Top NIT is loading. I am satisfied with this college. Faculty members are very good here. The education is moderate, and the college organises huge vacations with reasonable money. It provides good teachers, and excellent study environment, but infrastructure is not good. I am dissatisfied due to poor placements. It has good placements in 2020 but not in 2021. It is going to be a great institute in the future. This is a place of prosperity. A budget friendly college for simple life. Good Placements in my passing year and before. Good college as per fees and NAAC A+ grade. Why choose HIT, Dehradun? Everything you need to know about RIT. Overall, the college is good for B.Tech, and the fees are reasonable. Not the best, but DBS PG college is better than most of the other colleges. True review of HNBGU by a Student. Overall, I will give 4 stars out of 5 stars, including facilities, placement, and others. Optional college for taking admission. Good faculty, Average facility and average mess food. Dissatisfied of organised teacher holidays, great choice for students from weaker section. Really good infrastructure and good facilities. The fee is very affordable too. Life Science alumni of BFIT. A good college to pursue a degree. The faculty are highly qualified. Best college in Dehradun. Uttaranchal College of Science and technology. Summary for my college journey. Great infrastructure and placement opportunities. RIT College full review. Best college for pursuing MBA.",

        "Placements": "Placements: In NERIST there is good placement. The maximum placement was 22 LPA. Every year, there are many placements of every branch. This college has a decent placement record, with a significant percentage of students being placed at various companies. It is a good college in the north-east region.\nPlacements: Many students get placed in our college in many reputed companies. It is a good college for placements.\nPlacements: Very poor placements; 40\/450 students got placed with the highest package of 8 LPA and the lowest of 2.16 LPA. There is no dedicated placement officer and very poor conditions for placement but its getting better, and some new initiatives are being taken to make placements better.\nPlacements: Top recruiting companies like OIL, ICOL, BHEL, etc., visit our campus. Almost 41% of students are placed. The salary package has increased by 10%.\nPlacements: In the mechanical department, last year's final year batch had 45 students, out of which more than 50% of students got placed, about 10 students were preparing for GATE, 5 students were into MBA courses, and around 5-6 students were looking for placements. The highest salary package offered was 20 LPA by Oil. The lowest salary package offered was 4 LPA by several IT companies. Top recruiting companies were Oil, IOCL, BHEL, NEPCO, NHPC, NTPC, NRL, Tata, Tisco, Mahindra, etc. About 20% of students...\nPlacements: Placements are fine but few companies like OIL IOCL, etc. come for placement. Students opt for internships during summer from pre-final and final years. Around 3 to 4 students got placement in OIL and IOCL with 20 LPA.\nPlacements: It is a normal engineering college, not like IIT so student placements are not good, but many students get placed. Around 10% of students are placed because of covid-19 in the previous year. The minimum salary package offered is 4 LPA. I heard from a senior that ONGC came in a particular year. In the previous year, students did not go for any internships, but this year students are going for internships in a company name JCV Company Limited.\nPlacements: Placements are not so good in our college as it resides in remote area of Arunachal Pradesh in the North East region. Some of the public sector companies visit the campus for placements which include Tata, Asahi Glass, ONGC, OIL, NHPC, etc. Apart from that, other private companies like Tech Mahindra also visit the campus for placements at irregular intervals. But, this year it has been good in terms of placement as recently Google visited the campus for a placement with around 17 LPA.\nPlacements: Almost every student who searched for a job in our batch got one job, while others went to foreign or joined IITs for higher studies. Companies like Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, TCS and many more visit here for placements. Indian Army and some PSUs also visit the campus, but you need to be from the northeast region to be selected in those companies.\nPlacements: Placement attempts were not made here. Our college always makes excuses and blames the students. According to the college, the students are not good enough. However, the same students will get jobs on their own performance. All the high-profile jobs grabbed by alumni have been through off-campus placements. But our college shows wrong data that it has offered those jobs to just maintain its rank.\nPlacements: Around everyone who wants a job got placed and the rest of the students opt for M.Tech. The highest salary package offered was 16 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered was 3.5 LPA. Top recruiter was Infosys and Power Grid. Indian Army and Airforce were also visited for SSB selection. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Smart Tech, and others also visit to hire students.\nInfrastructure: Classrooms of our college are good. All kinds of instruments are available for practicals. The campus is not so good, but Wi-Fi is available on the campus. Hostel fee is a little expensive. Food provided is quite good. There is a central library where you will get all the necessary books. The medical facility is available in the campus. There is a free gym in the college. The infrastructure of the compound is not much attractive. Overall, you can study here if you don't get admission in Assam.\nPlacements: Around 33% of the students got placed. Maximum CTC was 3.6 LPA. Mostly IT companies visited our campus for recruitment. Only Bosch visited our campus for recruitment in the field of core mechanical engineering. Placement in the core mechanical\/civil engineering jobs is very poor. Students prepare for GATE and try to get into good colleges for M.Tech.\nPlacements: Expecting placements here is like expecting rain in the desert. Placements are really low, but a handful of students have been placed, with some getting placed in companies like Power Grid and OIL. Many recruiters don't visit the campus because of its location and also because the college has been pretty mediocre for a while.\nPlacements: Placements in the college were few and were mostly for students of computer science and IT branches. For mechanical, only one core PSU conducted the drive and recruited only 3 out of 50 odd students. Some companies which visited the college for placements included Wipro, Tech Mahindra, SAP Consultancy, Datazen Engineering, Power Grid, Tata Projects, and OIL. Overall in all branches, around 30% of the students were placed, and this ratio has been decreasing from the year 2010-11 and gradually ove...\nPlacements: Placements in our college are up to the level. The placement percentage of our senior batch was better than our batch. The main problem of our college is that it is in Arunachal Pradesh. To visit AP, one needs to have ILP (inner line permit), and because of this reason, most of the companies don't visit our college to offer placements.\nPlacements: There were no placements till 2014, and the placement rate has improved from 2015, but the placement cell is still far from decent. PSUs are visiting the campus, but they are not hiring more than 4 students. There is a huge room for improvement. Skill improvement sessions should be included in the course to improve the placement rate.\nPlacements: Placements were not much good for our course in 2017, but the placements are quite good for mechanical and civil branches. For CS, companies like Tech Mahindra, Wipro, SAP, etc., have visited our campus and offered the roles of analyst, software developer, and tester etc. There are some schemes for internships. The stipend offered to me was Rs. 8,000 per month during my internship.\nPlacements: A few years back, placements were good for the students of electronics and computer science departments in B.Tech programme but not for M.Tech students. Although we had good percentages, placements are too bad now. I did not see any M.Tech student get placed here. Earlier Wipro visited our campus, but now from 2 years, even they are not visiting our campus. The salary package offered is 3 to 6 LPA. Only 5% of students were offered internships from college. There is a placement cell, but I do not...\nPlacements: Placements for our batch and our senior batch were moderate. Around 30% of the students got placed. The highest salary package offered was 10 LPA. Companies like SAP, Wipro, Zaloni and Tata Zen have visited our campus. Almost 100% of the students were offered internships in different organisations. The highest stipend offered was Rs. 12,000 per month, and it was offered by IIT, Mumbai. There is a well-formed placement cell on our campus.",
        "Review": "Quality education at NERIST. I recommend students to take admission to this college. Life at NERIST, Arunachal Pradesh. Review of North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST). Our college has good infrastructure and facilities and is the best place for socialising. Our college has good infrastructure and facilities but dissatisfied with hostels. This is a good college for studying engineering. Students from here doing jobs abroad. Honest review of NERIST in 2022. There is value for money, and it is a central university in the Himalayas. I suggest you search for better colleges and keep it as the last option. This college is value for money. It is a good institution, especially for engineering. Enjoyed NERIST life with good faculty members but with a certain amount of hardship and sacrifice. Once the most prominent college in North East is now a mediocre one. Severely lacking placements. My college was good but not great. Overall campus placement and academics need improvement. Precisely, this was one of the best technical institutes in India. It had the best faculty members. We can have fun in hostels. Studies depend on you, and the infrastructure is average. Dissatisfied with placements in 2017, but the faculty and course curriculum were very good. I'm not satisfied because of placements.

We didn't have internship in our curriculum and everyone got placed on their own by their own efforts.\nInfrastructure: It is unfortunate to note that there hasn't been a tremendous progress in the infrastructure since it's inception more than 75 years back. Especially, the cramped spaces in an overcrowded hostel in De...\nPlacements: I am still studying, so I don't know much about the salary packages offered. However, I heard from our seniors that almost every student got placed. Generally, architecture jobs have really low salaries, so it depends on you whether you opt to do a job or put a firm.\nInfrastructure: The infrastructure of our college is very bad, and the food served is just fine. There are no proper facilities for sports and games. Hostels are very below average, and drainage will flow all over the hostels. Rooms are really small...\nPlacements: There are direct campus placements which will be offered for almost 25% of the students, and the rest will be placed soon after completing the course.

Still, the...\nPlacements: 100% of the students are placed by the time they complete their degree. The batch size is small of only 25 students. The highest salary is around 14LPA and the average is 5LPA. The lowest package offered is also around 4-5 LPA. Top recruiters are Deloitte, EY, Atkins, WSP, AECOM, Ramboll and few others. The job role is that of a transport planner, transport modeler, transport economist or logistics manager. Around 50% of the students got an internship in AECOM, WRI, World Bank, AITD, DIMTS, and ...\nPlacements: There is no provision of placements in this college. However, a placement cell is formed consisting of students of the final year of the course. Most of the students try themselves to get in an architectural firm as that will provide better opportunities. Students of B.Arch are mostly offered a salary around Rs. 35,000-40,000 per month. Architectural colleges work differently than other fields. As far as the internships are concerned, students have to send their portfolio of work to the firm of ...\nPlacements: It is widely claimed that the college is ranked nationwide with people having a million contacts, but there is no scope of placements in the college. With no placements, the college does not justify being called as an institute of national importance.\nInfrastructure: The infrastructure of our college doesn't even match the standard bar. It is ironic that the school teaches planning and architecture with such poor infrastructure. The conditions here are pathetic.\nPlacements: The issue with our college is that it doesn't have an active placement cell for the students of bachelors of planning. Out of a batch of 30 students, around 10 have been placed without any help from the college. However, internships provided by the college are satisfactory.\nInfrastructure: There are no medical facilities in the college. For sanitation and utilities, a lot of work is required to be done. Overall, the college lacks in providing proper infrastructure and facilities. There are no facilities for spor...\nPlacements: Our college doesn't provide placements. The placement committee was formed in 2018, the graduation year of my batch. Placements are provided to the Master's students from last year. As far as Bachelor's programme is concerned, the placement committee is yet to become active.\nInfrastructure: SPA was established in the late 1940s and is still operating on the same campus. The planning department building was built in the same year while the architecture block was built a few years later. Labs, library, sports faci...\nPlacements: There are only a few placement opportunities for students in the architecture department. Around 10% of the students got placed from the batch. The highest salary package offered was Rs. 35,000 per month and the lowest salary package offered was Rs. 25,000 per month. International companies like DAR and AECOM visited the campus and offered junior architect roles to students.\nInfrastructure: The campus does provide all the basic facilities, but the quality of the facilities provided is average. Labs and classroom...\nPlacements: Since last 3 years, the college is inviting firms and organisations for placements, but earlier, students didn't show interest neither did admin. But, the batch which graduated in 2017, did not get any profit with the so-called placement cell. This information is regarding B.Arch, and all the other departments have relatively better placements.\nInfrastructure: In recent years, the infrastructure is improving a bit due to the increased academic fee, but if we consider all the facilities, the infrastructure is too...\nPlacements: The salary is generally 35k to 50k for a fresher. There is no placement cell in college for every branch. It is recommended to have a placement cell in college to maintain the salary base. Salary is going down because there is no placement cell in college, this is the main issue.\nInfrastructure: There are good facilities in college like library, games, etc. The food in the canteen is not up to the mark.

The college holds a very good reputation among the firms.\nInfrastructure: Though being one the oldest college, it is well maintained. It has good facilities, like studios, labs, canteen, library. very well landscaped and bri...\nPlacements: The placements are still in the initial stages for all the departments except BEM. However, BEM is followed by transport planning, urban planning, urban design and industrial design department. As SPA is one of the best institutes in architecture and planning, so one should not worry about the job.\nInfrastructure: Very nice library, Wi-Fi is not available everywhere, but still accessible in most of the activity areas. Nice computer lab. The parking is available for all. Activity\/sports area is available in both ...\nPlacements: The companies visit the college for the placement, and even a person himself applied gets the job. They take interview and exams, and they see marks scored by the student in all the five years and the extracurricular activities.\nInfrastructure: The built infrastructure is not that great on the campus, but being a government college, still, the infrastructure is awesome, and what I saw in other college is even in the worse situation. But regarding the social infrastructure, the college is the best in the whole co...\nPlacements: There are 40 students enrolled every year for this course. Top companies which hire students from our department are Samsung, LG, POSCO, etc. The average package offered is between 6 Lacs to 10 Lacs for Bachelors degree.

The campus and hostel facilities are not good. Review of SPA Delhi - School of Planning and Architecture. It has horrible infrastructure but the most helpful and amazing people you'll find in any college. Dissatisfied by facilities but impressed by faculty and curriculum. If you are looking for fun along with studies, join this college. A college of national importance that can do much more than it's current state. Our college has the bad infrastructure, but the hostel life is good. Highly hectic curriculum and the field is not offering you many good opportunities. Interesting course, Good placements. Overall, it's a great college for architecture as compared to other colleges. The food and infrastructure are pathetic, and the placements are nil. The college needs to work on its management. Students can experience work and enjoyment. Faculty and curriculum are good, but infrastructure and placements need improvement. Good for academics, but can be improved a lot if government shows some interest. This is a college of national importance. I am an architect from SPA Delhi. SPAD, which each student should target if they are planning to go into architecture or planning. The college has the top faculty members. All the facilities are good and it is only with such facilities that the college excels.",
